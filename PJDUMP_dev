#PJDUMP - emulate incremental Cyber PFDUMP of <project-name> using predetermined directory names.
#  2/11/21.  18:00 PJLOAD NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN TO BRING PROJECT BACK TO
#            /Windows/../StagingArea-In
#                   FROM ../USB20FD/git-Projects ($BACKUP_PATH)
# Usage. bash PJDUMP <backup-path> <project-name>
#         <flash_drive> = flash drive for backup (e.g. USB20FD)
#         <project-name> = git project name (e.g. Libraries-Project)
# Entry. $BACKUP_PATH= '/media/ubuntu'
#		 WINGIT_PATH = base path of project to dump
# Because of the volatility of ubuntu non-persistent, and the risk of unexpected crashes
# git projects should only be modified on the Windows hard-drive. This stands the best chance
# of not losing local changes.
# If the local project on the /Windows/ hard drive is corrupted, this backup will provide two
#  options: # 1) delete the Project on the /Windows hard drive and use PJLOAD to do a full
# reload, then PJDESTAGE to clone it back from the StagingArea-In, or 2) use
# "git clone origin <project-name>" to re-clone from the last push to GitHub.
#
# Modification History.
# --------------------
# 7/24/20. wmk.	WARNING added to not run anything else while project backup
# 		is in progress; updated to use new environment vars $U_DISK
#               and $PJ_BACK
# 7/25/20. wmk. changed line 108 to evaluate bu_ainthere before testing
#               string length
# 2/11/21. wmk. mods to use LOGMSG to log dump to system log; FD and GP
#				environment vars added.
# 7/17/20. Notes. A new bash shell is expected to be resident on each primary
# <project-name> path, named BU-Ignores.sh. This bash script will be invoked
# by PJDUMP to backup files that are ignored by git during cloning or commit
# operations. These files are spec'd in each project's .gitignore file by
# patterns (e.g. *.odt). Each BU-Ignores script is programmed to take those
# files and move them to the backup <project-name> for preservation. These
# are typically untracked files, not integrated with the project itself,
# but used during project development and testing. The environment variable
# BACKUP_PATH is set by PJDUMP and exported for use by other bash scripts.
#
# 7/16/20. Notes. To eliminate using StagingAreas, it is simpler to go to the target
# device's /git-Projects/subdirectory and rename the <project-name> subdirectory by
# appending an '_' to the <project-name> subdirectory. This frees the <project-name>
# subdirectory to receive a clone of the project by just using "git clone". The user
# have to ensure that any files spec'd in .gitignore are copied to the dump area
# separately from the "git clone".
