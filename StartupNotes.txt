#Notes on starting Ubuntu (non-persistent)	7/19/20.
# copy Startup.sh from /media/ubuntu/Users/Bill/Documents to $USER/Documents
# use chmod +x Startup.sh, then ./Startup.sh to connect to the universal-repository
# and set the timezone correctly to America/New_York
# Feature. 7/18/20. Add SYSEDIT bash (#!/bin/bash) to the startup sequence to
# emulate a SYSEDIT on the old CDC systems. This bash shell should do the following:
#	* initialize the System Log ($HOME/SystemLog.txt) with startup message
#	* create the ~/temp directory for scratch file use
#	* set the system time to the correct timezone
# 	* run KillTPad.sh to kill the HP touchpad
#       * add the universe repository
#	* install git
#	* install Geany
#	* install JDK (Java-Development Kit)
#	* copy the following
#	   from /media/ubuntu/Windows/Users/Bill/Documents/ubuntu/Documents
#	  * copy .bashrc to $HOME
#	  * copy .ssh subdirectory to $HOME
#	  * copy .gitconfig to $HOME
#	* change all permissions on all files in .ssh subdirectory to "none"
#	* install Zoom
#	* prompt user to use LibreCalc to Import BadAss and Standard/Module1/DayName
#	   and load customized keyboard Alpha.cfg
#       * enable ssa-agent for bash
# Any bash shells written to accomplish the above tasks should record their activity
# in the SystemLog.txt file on $HOME. Log entries will consist of timestamp followed
# by the activity log entry. The first SYSEDIT startup bash should also record the
# log entry date ]\n "System startup."
# until figure out where LibreCalc stores MyMacros, need to Import BadAss and Standard
# Module1/DayName from
# OpenOffice.org Calc /media/ubunut/Users/Bill/Appdata/Roaming/OpenOffice/4/basic
# subdirectories in order for the AlphaCleanAccounting2020test_.ods and others to work. 
# Also need to install JRE for Calc extended functions like "Customize". Easiest seems
# to be to install the entire JDK using InstallJDK.sh stored on ../Bill../ubuntu/Documents
#
# git needs to be installed. There is a shell file on Windows../Bill../ubuntu/Documents
# Installgit.sh that can be run from the Terminal to install git.
# .gitconfig needs to be copied to the $HOME path, and also to each project path that
# is cloned from GitHub git clone https://git@github.com/UbuntuGeezer/<project>.git
# then also need to get ssh set up so can assign origin to
# ssh://git@github.com/UbuntuGeezer/<project>.git (it does not appear to be enough to
# just copy the .ssh subdirectory from Windows; appears to be operating-system dependent
# on personal key assignment..(see .ssh notes below)
# Also, for convenience, edit .bashrc on the $HOME directory and have some git command aliases
# defined.. alias ga="git add" | alias got='git'
#
# .ssh folder on the $HOME path needs to be set up to enable ssh data communications. Also
# ssh-agent needs to be running. The terminal command exec ssa-agent bash allows the ssa-agent
# to be run from the Terminal for processing ssh requests to a host. ssh and gpa protocols
# are defined for each user on the server. GitHub/<user>/Settings has methods to add ssh
# public keys for different machines/operating systems. The ssh-rsa.pub file contains the
# encryption key for public access. It has been set up on GitHub by copying the file content
# to the clipboard, then entering it in the GitHub settings as an additional key for access.
# the ssh file passwords are set to a Hebrew word.
# On system restart, a new session of ssh-agent needs to be started and the .ssh key(s) added.
# use the following bash commands: exec ssh-agent bash, followed by ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
#  If, for some reason, ssh access to GitHub is refused, either the permissions are wrong on 
# the key files (need to be set to 600 which only allows read/write for owner) or something
# is amiss due to a system restart with non-persistent ubuntu. If resetting the permissions
# does not cure the problem, it is simple enough to generate new key pairs. 
#
# Zoom needs to be reinstalled. .deb file is on Windows../Bill../ubuntu/Downloads and
# InstallZoom.sh is on ../ubuntu/Documents. Easiest is to copy both to $HOME/Downloads
# and add with chmod then run InstallZoom.sh
#
