# --------------------
# 7/??/20.  wmk.	original script
# 7/24/29.  wmk.	modified to display ~/term_user_msg.txt if it exists;
#                       this allows for a reminder text to be saved and displayed
#                       the next time term_ starts up.
# 8/5/20.	wmk.	get term_user_msg.txt from persistent storage.
# 2/12/21.	wmk.	LOGMSG used to message to system_log.
# 2/14/21.	wmk.	bu_ environment var set /media/ubuntu/Windows/StagingAreaIn
# 2/21/21.	wmk.	LOGMSG direct calls failed; use sysprocs path.
# 6/16/21.	wmk.	multihost support added; ($)system_log entry for day start.
# Notes.
# By entering the "term_" command, the user makes a $system_log entry
# with the time stamp of when the bash session was started. [If a parameter
# is included, it will be a quoted literal that will also be recorded in
# the $system_log.] If the file ~/term_user_msg.txt exists, it will be displayed.
# If this is the first time term has been started since termx X, a system log
# message is created with a date/time stamp indicating that the User session day
# started. This is to facilitate dividing the system log by days where
# no timer is running at midnight when the date rolls over. (See termx shell.)
